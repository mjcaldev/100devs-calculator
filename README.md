@mjcaldev here. 

I added a lot of extra to this project to use it as an excuse to go the simple "switch/case" method and to read up on modern, object-based approach with better error handling, modularity, and potential for features (better.js).

I also needed to practice api hits so I did that too. One with classic .then logic and the other with modern async/await.

I really had fun diving into the different approaches here and reading about the differences.
